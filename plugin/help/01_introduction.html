    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        This plug-in offers tight integration of system file manager (Windows Explorer,
        Gnome Nautilus, KDE Konqueror, Mac Finder, ...) and shell (cmd.exe, Linux/Mac
        terminal) in Eclipse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every now and then when working with Eclipse you'd like to examine a file or a 
        folder inside the Eclipse workspace with your file manager or open a shell/cmd.exe
        in this location. Or you edit a file in Eclipse and would like to open the parent
        folder of this file in the file manager or shell. Or the file you are editing
        contains a string which references another file in the filesystem and you would like
        to do some of the things mentioned above with that referenced file. This plug-in
        gives you a convenient way to do all this by adding a few entries to Eclipse's
        context menus. Furthermore, it offers a different, more convenient way to issue
        any shell/dos command you like through customizable menu commands. Last but not
        the least this plug-in offers a tighter integration of the clip board, so copying
        a file's/folder's path to the clip board is only two mouse clicks (instead of
        opening the Properties dialog and selecting the path manually). 
      </p>
      <p>
        This plug-in is inherently not platform-independent. Currently, the following
        operating systems/desktop environments are supported out of the box:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows</li>
        <li>Mac OS</li>
        <li>Linux with Gnome</li>
        <li>Linux with KDE</li>
        <li>Linux with Xfce</li>
        <li>Linux with LXDE</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, even if your system is not listed there, you can still easily configure 
        StartExplorer to work correctly on your system.
