      <h1>Editors: Context Menu Options for Resources Opened In Editors and Selected Text Regions in Editors</h1>
      <p>
      In editors (Java editor, XML editor, text editor, ...) you also can execute StartExplorer actions,
      either on an empty text selection (that is, just right click anywhere in the editor
      window without selecting text first) or for a selected text region. 
      StartExplorer offers the following options here:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Start file manager in this path</li>
          <li>Start shell in this path</li>
          <li>Open in default application</li>
          <li>Copy resource path to clipboard</li>
          <li><a href="05_custom_commands.html">Custom Commands</a></li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        These are the same options as for resource views like Navigator, Package Explorer or
        Project Explorer, just named a bit different.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference to the commands for resource is that these commands work based
        either on the file that is currently opened in the editor <i>or</i> based
        on the selected text region in the editor.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
      	  If no text is selected, the operation is executed on the file currently opened
      	  in the editor. This basically works the same way as if the file in the editor would
      	  have been selected in a resource view like Package Explorer.
      	</li>
      	<li>
          If some text is selected, the plug-in behaves quite differently and it is important to
          understand how StartExplorer works with selected text regions, otherwise you might get
          unexpected results: When text is selected, the plug-in interprets the selected text
          region as a file system path, denoting either a folder or a file. If this path is
          a folder, the plug-in can open a file manager or a shell for this folder. If the
          aforementioned path refers to a file rather than a directory, the plug-in can start
          the default system application for it. 
      	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Actually, StartExplorer is a bit smarter when handling selected text regions 
        than the last paragraph may give the impression. If you try to open a file manager 
        for your selection it doesn't matter whether you selected a path denoting
        a folder or a file. If the selected text region points to a file, the parent directory
        of that file is shown in the file manager and the file is selected, just as you
        would expect. Furthermore, if the path ends with an incomplete path segment, the last
        segment is discarded.
        Example: In your text file (or XML file or whatever) you have the path 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory\file.xyz</code>. Now you select just 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\dire</code> and start a file manager for that path.
        The plug-in recognizes that <code>C:\path\to\some\dire</code> is not a valid path
        and tries the parent directory <code>C:\path\to\some</code>. If this is a valid,
        existing directory, a file manager window pops up showing <code>C:\path\to\some</code>.
        If you select &quot;Start shell in this path&quot; for 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory\file.xyz</code> then the directory
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory</code> will be shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the option &quot;Copy resource path to clipboard&quot; does not make
        a lot of sense with a text selection because it more or less only copies the
        selected text to the clipboard (with the difference that it might be reduced to a
        valid file system path, see above). But it still makes sense with empty text
        selections because in that case it copies the path of the file that is currently
        opened in the editor to the clipboard.

        The <a href="05_custom_commands.html">custom commands</a> are 
        completely configurable through the preference page,
        just as for the resource-based commands.
