      <p>
        This plug-in offers tight integration of system file manager (Windows Explorer,
        Gnome Nautilus, KDE Konqueror, Mac Finder, ...) and shell (cmd.exe, Linux/Mac
        terminal) in Eclipse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every now and then when working with Eclipse you'd like to examine a file or a 
        folder inside the Eclipse workspace with your file manager or open a shell/cmd.exe
        in this location. Or you edit a file in Eclipse and would like to open the parent
        folder of this file in the file manager or shell. Or the file you are editing
        contains a string which references another file in the filesystem and you would like
        to do some of the things mentioned above with that referenced file. This plug-in
        gives you a convenient way to do all this by adding a few entries to Eclipse's
        context menus. Furthermore, it offers a different, more convenient way to issue
        any shell/dos command you like through customizable menu commands. Last but not
        the least this plug-in offers a tighter integration of the clip board, so copying
        a file's/folder's path to the clip board is only two mouse clicks (instead of
        opening the Properties dialog and selecting the path manually). 
      </p>
      <p>
        This plug-in is inherently not platform-independent. Currently, the following
        operating systems/desktop environments are supported out of the box:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows</li>
        <li>Mac OS</li>
        <li>Linux with Gnome</li>
        <li>Linux with KDE</li>
        <li>Linux with Xfce</li>
        <li>Linux with LXDE</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, even if your system is not listed there, you can still easily configure 
        StartExplorer to work correctly on your system.

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h3>Context Menu Options for Resource Views</h3>
      In resource views like the Navigator or Package Explorer you can select files
      and folders. StartExplorer offers the following options here:
       <ol>
          <li>Show in file manager</li>
          <li>Start shell here</li>
          <li>Open files with default application</li>
          <li>Copy resource path to clipboard</li>
          <li>Custom Commands</li>
       </ol>
      <p>
      All options work with a single selected resource as well as with multiple
      resources. If multiple resources are selected and an option only works for 
      files (or only for folders) all resources of the wrong type are ignored
      and the command is executed for the resources it is applicable for.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Show in file manager:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Starts a file manager (depending on your system, this might be the Windows
      Explorer, Finder on Mac OS, Nautilus on Gnome, Konqueror on KDE, Thunar on Xfce
      or PCMan File Manager on LXDE) for the selected resource. If it is a folder, the
      file manager is opened for this folder. If it is a file, the file manager 
      is opened for the parent folder of this file. On some systems (currently on 
      Windows and Mac OS) the file is also selected/highlighted in the file manager.
      If multiple resources are selected, a separate file manager instance is
      opened for each resource.      
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Start shell here:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Opens a shell/terminal/command line prompt with the selected folder
      as its starting directory. If multiple resources are selected, separate
      shells are opened for each of them. If a file is selected, a 
      shell for its parent directory will be opened. 
      </p>      
      <p>
      <b>Open files with default application:</b> (Works for files only)
      Opens the selected file in the application that is registered for
      this file type in your system. If multiple resources are selected then for each 
      resource the default application will be started separately.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Copy resource path to clipboard:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Copies the absolute path of the selected resource to the clipboard.
      If multiple resources are selected, all resource paths are copied
      to the clipboard, separated by a Unix linebreak. The separator
      can be configured in the preference page for this plug-in.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Custom Commands:</b> You can configure any command you like here.
      <br><a href="#top">Top</a>   
      </p>       

      <h3>Context Menu Options for Resources Opened In Editors and Selected Text Regions in Editors</h3>
      <p>
      In editors (Java editor, text editor, ...) you also can execute StartExplorer actions,
      either on an empty text selection (that is, just right click anywhere in the editor
      window without selecting text first) or for a selected text region. 
      StartExplorer offers the following options here:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Start file manager in this path</li>
          <li>Start shell in this path</li>
          <li>Open in default application</li>
          <li>Copy resource path to clipboard</li>
          <li>Custom Commands</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        These are the same options as for resource views like Navigator, Package Explorer or
        Project Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference to the commands for resource is that these commands work based
        either on the file that is currently opened in the editor <i>or</i> based
        on the selected text region in the editor.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
      	  If no text is selected, the operation is executed on the file currently opened
      	  in the editor. This basically works the same way as if the file in the editor would
      	  have been selected in a resource view like Package Explorer.
      	</li>
      	<li>
          If some text is selected, the plug-in behaves quite differently and it is important to
          understand how StartExplorer works with selected text regions, otherwise you might get
          unexpected results: When text is selected, the plug-in interprets the selected text
          region as a file system path, denoting either a folder or a file. If this path is
          a folder, the plug-in can open a file manager or a shell for this folder. If the
          aforementioned path refers to a file rather than a directory, the plug-in can start
          the default system application for it. 
      	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Actually, StartExplorer is a bit smarter when handling selected text regions 
        than the last paragraph may give the impression. If you try to open a file manager 
        for your selection it doesn't matter whether you selected a path denoting
        a folder or a file. If the selected text region points to a file, the parent directory
        of that file is shown in the file manager and the file is selected, just as you
        would expect. Furthermore, if the path ends with an incomplete path segment, the last
        segment is discarded.
        Example: In your text file (or XML file or whatever) you have the path 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory\file.xyz</code>. Now you select just 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\dire</code> and start a file manager for that path.
        The plug-in recognizes that <code>C:\path\to\some\dire</code> is not a valid path
        and tries the parent directory <code>C:\path\to\some</code>. If this is a valid,
        existing directory, a file manager window pops up showing <code>C:\path\to\some</code>.
        If you select &quot;Start shell in this path&quot; for 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory\file.xyz</code> then the directory
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory</code> will be shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the option &quot;Copy resource path to clipboard&quot; does not make
        a lot of sense with a text selection because it more or less only copies the
        selected text to the clipboard (with the difference that it might be reduced to a
        valid file system path, see above). But it still makes sense with empty text
        selections because in that case it copies the path of the file that is currently
        opened in the editor to the clipboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        The custom commands are completely configurable through the preference page,
        just as for the resource-based commands.

        There is always more than one way to skin a cat. Or to open a file manager window.
        It seems many people miss this functionality in Eclipse and some of them (like me)
        wrote plug-ins to ease their pain. I'll list all I know of here. If you know
        another open-file-manager-plug-in, let me know. I also list some pros and cons,
        which, of course, are completely subjective.
